            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>


            <p>Last updated: Feb 26, 2018</p>


            <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the
                www.greathearts.community or https://app.greathearts.community websites (the "Service") operated by
                Great Hearts Initiatives ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these
                Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

            <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of
                the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>


            <h2>Communications</h2>

            <p>By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional
                materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these
                communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we
                send.</p>


            <h2>Purchases</h2>

            <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may
                be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your
                credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping
                information.</p>

            <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment
                method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true,
                correct and complete.</p>

            <p>The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the
                completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the
                information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to:
                product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in
                your order or other reasons.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is
                suspected.</p>


            <h2>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>

            <p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in
                updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on
                the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services
                may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the
                accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.</p>

            <p>We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or
                omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>


            <!--<h2>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h2>-->

            <!--<p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms &amp; Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, the Promotion rules will apply.</p>-->


            <!--<h2>Subscriptions</h2>-->

            <!--<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>-->

            <!--<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Great Hearts Initiative cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Great Hearts Initiative customer support team.</p>-->

            <!--<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Great Hearts Initiative with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Great Hearts Initiative to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>-->

            <!--<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Great Hearts Initiative will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>-->


            <!--<h2>Fee Changes</h2>-->

            <!--<p>Great Hearts Initiative, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>-->

            <!--<p>Great Hearts Initiative will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>-->

            <!--<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>-->


            <!--<h2>Refunds</h2>-->

            <!--<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Great Hearts Initiative on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Great Hearts Initiative.</p>-->

                text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post

                violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any
                person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a
                copyright.</p>

            <p>You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the
                Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no
                liability for Content you or any third party posts on or through the Service. However, by posting
                Content using the Service you grant us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly

                your Content subject to these Terms.</p>

            <p>Great Hearts Initiative has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit all Content provided by

                advance written permission from us.</p>


            <h2>Accounts</h2>

            <p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the
                information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or
                obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.</p>

            <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not
                limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility
                for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your
                password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming
                aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            <p>You may not use as a username or avatar picture the name of another person or entity or that is not
                lawfully available for
                use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you,
